## Example1
![](img/Example1.png)
Simulated data with 700 data points between `t_0 = 0` and `t_1 = 12`. The data contains three different signals with frequencies of `4`, `2` and `0.4`
with random noise added on top. Additionally, I have added a jump in the data set to showcase that it is possible to remove such signatures.
